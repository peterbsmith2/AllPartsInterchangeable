## Quote
> Journalism is still an individual act. It's still one guy or one girl with a notepad and a certain degree of arrogance. You know, the effrontery of saying "I'm going to tell you what happened in the world yesterday." That's why I went into it. It was a place you went into when you were politically unaligned and you thought anger wasn't necessarily a bad civic thing.

Tonight there are 4 total shell script problems. As a team, divide into 4 task groups, one per problem.  
  
Work on the problem together, and after food, present your answer to everyone.  
 
**The goal is to explain the solution to the group. Great coders steal great code. So it is okay to look up the answer.**
